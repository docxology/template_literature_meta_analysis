"""Reproducibility workflow graph models.

Provides ``NodeType``, ``WorkflowNode``, ``WorkflowEdge``, and
``WorkflowGraph`` dataclasses along with a pure graph-assembly function
and JSONL serialization/merge/append helpers, following the same
patterns as :mod:`knowledge_graph.nanopublication`.

A workflow graph decomposes a paper's described pipeline into discrete
steps (source data, methods, experiments, sinks/outputs) and records how
confidently each step could be reproduced from the paper's own text.

Edge direction convention
--------------------------
``WorkflowNode.depends_on`` lists the raw (possibly-dangling) ``node_id``
values a node depends on -- i.e. upstream nodes that must exist/run
before this node makes sense. The source paper's own vocabulary for
"workflow node" does not specify a canonical edge-object direction, so
this is a deliberate modeling choice, not a claim from the source paper.

When :func:`build_workflow_graph` resolves ``depends_on`` references into
``WorkflowEdge`` objects for ``WorkflowGraph.edges``, each edge points
FROM the depended-on (upstream) node TO the depending (downstream) node::

    WorkflowEdge(source_node_id=<upstream node id>, target_node_id=<downstream node id>)

This mirrors the natural data-flow direction through the pipeline
(source -> method -> experiment -> sink) rather than the "depends on"
direction, so that simple graph-theoretic degree measures line up with
the reproducibility questions we actually care about:

- A SOURCE node that many downstream steps depend on accumulates
  *out-edges* (edges whose ``source_node_id`` is the SOURCE node) --
  so out-degree on a SOURCE node measures how much of the pipeline
  rests on it (source fan-out).
- A SINK node that depends on a long chain of upstream steps
  accumulates *in-edges* (edges whose ``target_node_id`` is the SINK
  node) -- so in-degree on a SINK node measures how much of the
  pipeline had to succeed to reach it (sink fan-in).

References that do not resolve against the known ``node_id`` set (a
paper mentioning a step that was never itself extracted as a node) are
dropped from ``edges`` and counted in ``dangling_reference_count``
instead of raising -- extraction is inherently partial, and a dangling
reference is signal (something the paper alludes to but that our
extraction did not capture as its own node), not an error.

Cycle handling
--------------
Neither :func:`build_workflow_graph` nor :class:`WorkflowNode` prevents
a cycle in ``depends_on`` (e.g. node A depends on B, B depends on A).
The source paper assumes an acyclic workflow, but an LLM can emit a
cyclic dependency graph. All scoring functions in
:mod:`reproducibility.scoring` handle cycles correctly: BFS-based
functions (``source_sink_path_coverage``, ``weak_component_coverage``)
use ``visited`` sets that prevent infinite traversal, and degree-based
functions (``source_consumption``, ``sink_production``) are inherently
cycle-safe. A cycle is therefore scored without error but will lower
``rc4`` (path coverage) since a cycle cannot reach a SINK that is not
already in the cycle, and ``rc5`` (cohesion) will treat the entire cycle
as one weakly-connected component.
