# Source Code - Agent Directives

Project source for the literature meta-analysis exemplar. All domain behavior lives here; scripts are thin stage wrappers.

## Core Rules

1. Keep logic in `src/`, not in `scripts/`.
2. Keep tests real: no mocks, local HTTP servers for HTTP behavior, temp files for I/O.
3. Keep stochastic analysis deterministic with seed `42` unless config explicitly overrides it.
4. Keep config-driven domain policy in `manuscript/config.yaml`.
5. Link `../../../docs/_generated/COUNTS.md` for live test/coverage facts instead of hardcoding them.

## Dependency Graph

```text
literature        -> no project-src dependencies
analysis          -> literature.models
knowledge_graph   -> literature.models
visualization     -> serialized analysis/KG JSON inputs
manuscript        -> output JSON + config only
scripts           -> src modules + optional infrastructure helpers
```

Do not introduce cycles across these layers.
