"""Unified corpus management.

Provides a Corpus class that manages collections of Paper objects with
deduplication, merging, persistence (JSONL format), and filtering
capabilities.

Deduplication is two-tiered:

1. **Canonical-ID dedup** (``add()``): papers with the same
   ``canonical_id`` (DOI-normalized, PMID, arXiv, S2, OpenAlex, or title
   hash) are merged by keeping the version with higher
   ``metadata_completeness``. This is the primary dedup path and runs
   automatically on every ``add()``.
2. **Metadata dedup** (``deduplicate_by_metadata()``): papers with the
   same ``publication_signature`` (normalized title + first-3-author
   signature) but different ``canonical_id`` values (e.g. a preprint on
   arXiv and the published version on Crossref) are collapsed, preferring
   preprints or published versions based on the ``prefer_preprints`` flag.
   This is a secondary, opt-in pass that catches cross-engine duplicates
   that escaped canonical-ID dedup because they have different identifiers.

Persistence is atomic: ``save()`` writes to a ``.jsonl.tmp`` file first,
then renames to the final path, so an interrupted write never produces a
truncated or partially-written corpus file. This mirrors the atomic-write
convention in :mod:`reproducibility.models.append_workflow_graphs` and
:mod:`literature.fulltext_download.download_fulltext`.
