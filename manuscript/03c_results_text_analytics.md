# Results: Language, Topics, and Embeddings

## RQ3: Topical and Linguistic Structure

Text analysis operates over titles, abstracts, and (when available) full text. A TF-IDF
representation over a {{NUM_VOCAB_FEATURES}}-feature vocabulary feeds non-negative matrix
factorization, which extracts {{NUM_TOPICS}} latent topics cross-cutting the subfield
taxonomy. The top vocabulary terms are: {{TOP_VOCAB_TERMS}}.

**Table 3. NMF topics extracted from the corpus.**

{{TOPIC_TABLE}}

The topics reveal the thematic structure of the literature: Topic 0 centres on cognitive
enhancement and neuroenhancement; Topic 1 addresses ADHD treatment and clinical evidence;
Topic 2 covers pharmacological dose-response studies (including animal models); Topic 3
focuses on sleep disorders (narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness); and Topic 4
addresses fatigue in psychiatric populations. These topics cross-cut the keyword-based
subfield taxonomy, revealing connections that the explicit classification does not
capture.

## Document Embeddings

Offline deterministic embeddings (TF-IDF followed by truncated SVD) place every document
in a shared 50-dimensional vector space. Embedding the same text twice yields identical
vectors, so the derived similarity matrix, nearest-neighbour lists, clusters, and
two-dimensional projection are all reproducible.

## Term Analysis

The TF-IDF term heatmap reveals which terms discriminate between subfields: terms with
high between-subfield variance (rather than high global mean) are selected for display.

<!-- FIGURE: term_heatmap.png -->
![Term heatmap for {{SEARCH_TERM_TITLE}}. Each cell shows the mean TF-IDF weight of a term within a subfield. Terms are selected by between-subfield variance to highlight discriminative vocabulary rather than globally frequent terms.](../output/figures/term_heatmap.png "Term Heatmap"){{#fig:term_heatmap}}

## Named Entity Analysis

Named entity extraction over the {{ABSTRACT_COUNT}} abstracts identified {{NUM_ENTITIES}}
unique entities. The most frequent entities reflect the clinical and pharmacological
vocabulary of the modafinil literature.

The horizontal bar chart shows the 20 most frequently extracted named entities from abstracts, revealing the dominant drugs, conditions, and concepts in the literature.](../output/figures/entity_bar_chart.png "Named Entities"){{#fig:entity_bar_chart}}

## Embedding Similarity and Clustering

The TF-IDF/SVD embeddings place every document in a 50-dimensional vector space. K-means
clustering with $k = {{NUM_EMBEDDING_CLUSTERS}}$ clusters partitions the corpus into
topically coherent groups. The top similar document pairs, ranked by cosine similarity,
reveal the most closely related works in the corpus.

**Table 6. Top 10 most similar document pairs.**

High-similarity pairs share topical and lexical content.](../output/figures/similarity_heatmap.png "Similar Document Pairs"){{#fig:similarity_heatmap}}

<!-- FIGURE: word_cloud.png -->
![Term cloud for {{SEARCH_TERM_TITLE}}. Term sizes are proportional to their TF-IDF weights across the corpus, providing a visual summary of the dominant vocabulary.](../output/figures/word_cloud.png "Term Cloud"){{#fig:word_cloud}}

<!-- FIGURE: cooccurrence_matrix.png -->
![Term co-occurrence matrix for {{SEARCH_TERM_TITLE}}. Each cell shows the normalized co-occurrence frequency of two terms within the same document, revealing which concepts tend to appear together in the literature.](../output/figures/cooccurrence_matrix.png "Term Co-occurrence"){{#fig:cooccurrence_matrix}}

These embeddings support semantic retrieval over the corpus and the visual map of the
literature's topical geography.
