# Appendix B: Technical Notes

## Determinism

All stochastic steps use fixed seeds (seed = 42 for NMF, SVD, and graph layouts). The
fixture corpus, TF-IDF/SVD embeddings, and topic factorization are byte-stable across
runs. Graph centrality scores are rounded to a fixed precision and ranked with a
node-id tiebreaker so that floating-point non-associativity in iterative solvers cannot
perturb the reported rankings. Record identity uses a content digest (SHA-1,
`usedforsecurity=False`) rather than a salted hash, so de-duplication and corpus
byte-stability hold across processes.

## Data Model

Each record is a `Paper` dataclass with: title, abstract, authors (list of `Author`),
year, DOI, arXiv ID, Semantic Scholar ID, OpenAlex ID, venue, citation count, references
(list of canonical IDs), publication date, PDF URL, open-access flag, and full-text
source. The canonical identifier hierarchy governs de-duplication and citation resolution:

$$
\text{canonical\_id} = \begin{cases}
\texttt{doi:} + \text{normalize}(\text{DOI}) & \text{if DOI present} \\
\texttt{arxiv:} + \text{arXiv\_id} & \text{if arXiv ID present} \\
\texttt{s2:} + \text{S2\_id} & \text{if S2 ID present} \\
\texttt{openalex:} + \text{OpenAlex\_id} & \text{if OpenAlex ID present} \\
\texttt{title:} + \text{SHA1}(\text{title})[:16] & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

DOI normalization lower-cases the DOI and strips any `https://doi.org/` or `dx.doi.org/`
prefix, so the same paper returned by two engines under different case or format variants
merges to a single canonical ID.

## NMF Mathematics

Non-negative matrix factorization decomposes the TF-IDF document-term matrix
$\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ (where $m$ is the number of documents and $n$ is the
vocabulary size) into $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ and $\mathbf{H} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$,
where $k$ is the number of topics (here {{NUM_TOPICS}}). The factorization minimizes:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{H} \geq 0} \|\mathbf{V} - \mathbf{W} \mathbf{H}\|_F^2
$$

using multiplicative update rules [@lee1999learning] with a fixed random seed for
reproducibility. The topic-term matrix $\mathbf{H}$ gives the top terms per topic; the
document-topic matrix $\mathbf{W}$ gives each document's topic loadings.

## Growth Rate Estimation

The compound annual growth rate is:

$$
\text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{N_{\text{end}}}{N_{\text{start}}}\right)^{1/(T_{\text{end}} - T_{\text{start}})} - 1
$$

where $N_{\text{start}}$ and $N_{\text{end}}$ are the publication counts in the first and
last years of the corpus, respectively. The doubling time is
$t_d = \ln(2) / \ln(1 + \text{CAGR})$. For this run: CAGR = {{CAGR_PCT}}\%, doubling time
= {{DOUBLING_TIME}} years.

## Configuration Surface

A single `manuscript/config.yaml` controls the search term, per-engine query and keyword
sets, engine enable toggles, subfield taxonomy, hypotheses, full-text and embedding
options, and paper metadata. This run drew on {{N_ENGINES}} engines, a
{{N_SUBFIELDS}}-bucket taxonomy, and {{N_HYPOTHESES}} hypotheses.
