# Retrieval and De-duplication

Retrieval dispatches the configured query across 7 independent literature
engines (arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, Crossref, PubMed, SovietRxiv, and ChinaRxiv). Each engine is an isolated adapter exposing a uniform
`search(query) -> list[Record]` interface; engines that are keyless — arXiv, OpenAlex
[@priem2022openalex], Crossref [@hendricks2020crossref], PubMed/Entrez
[@sayers2022entrez], SovietRxiv / RussiaRxiv, and ChinaRxiv — need no credentials,
while Semantic Scholar [@kinney2023semantic] uses a key when present. SovietRxiv is a
translated archive of Soviet-era scientific preprints sourced from Math-Net.Ru and
CyberLeninka [@sovietrxiv]; ChinaRxiv serves translated Chinese preprints from ChinaXiv
via the same unified API. Both retain original-language PDFs alongside each translation,
and their polite rate-limit pool (300/min vs 30/min anonymous) is activated by an
optional `X-API-Email` header. Optional full-text resolution queries Unpaywall
[@piwowar2018state] for open-access locations. **Multiple dispatch degrades gracefully**:
an engine that is disabled in the configuration, lacks a required key, or cannot reach
the network returns a *skipped* status, and the run completes from the remaining engines
plus the committed offline corpus.

## Engine Details

Each engine adapter follows a uniform contract: a module-level API URL constant, a pure
`_parse_*` parser function, and a `search_*` entry point with pagination, retry, and
graceful error handling. All functions accept an injectable `base_url` parameter for
hermetic testing with `pytest-httpserver` — no engine hardcodes its URL inside the
function body.

| Engine | Rate limit | Pagination | Auth | Records (this run) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arXiv | 3s between requests | 100/page, offset | Keyless | Sparse |
| Semantic Scholar | 1 req/s (unauth.) | 100/page, offset | Optional key | Skipped (429) |
| OpenAlex | Polite pool (mailto) | 200/page, cursor | Keyless | 1,000 |
| Crossref | Polite pool (mailto) | 1,000/page, offset | Keyless | 1,000 |
| PubMed | NCBI usage policy | retstart/retmax | Keyless | 986 |
| SovietRxiv | 30/min (300/min polite) | 1–100/page, cursor | `X-API-Email` | 0 |
| ChinaRxiv | 30/min (300/min polite) | 1–100/page, cursor | `X-API-Email` | 0 |

SovietRxiv and ChinaRxiv returned zero records for the modafinil query, which is
expected: the Soviet-era archive covers mathematics, physics, and engineering
preprints, while ChinaXiv covers Chinese scientific preprints, and neither domain has
substantial modafinil literature. The engines dispatched correctly, queried the live
API, and returned empty result sets without error — confirming graceful degradation.

## Canonical Identifier Hierarchy

Heterogeneous records are reconciled by a **canonical identifier hierarchy** —
DOI $>$ arXiv ID $>$ Semantic Scholar ID $>$ OpenAlex ID $>$ a stable digest of the
normalized title. When two records share a canonical identifier they are merged, keeping
the version with the most complete metadata (a count of non-None optional fields). The
DOI is normalized: case-folded, resolver-prefix stripped, so the same paper returned by
two engines under case/format-variant DOIs merges. For this run, 2248 records
carry DOIs, 932 carry OpenAlex IDs, and 1 carry arXiv
IDs. The de-duplicated corpus for this run holds $N = 2302$ records published
across 2000--2026.

## Relevance Filtering

After de-duplication, a relevance filter drops papers whose title and abstract contain
none of the configured relevance keywords (modafinil, armodafinil, provigil, wakefulness, narcolepsy, cognitive enhancement, alertness, sleep deprivation, vigilance, eugeroic). Keywords are matched
case-insensitively; an empty keyword list is treated as no filter to avoid silently
wiping the corpus. A year filter then excludes papers published before the configured
start year (2000).
