# Conclusion

We have presented a configurable, reproducible meta-analysis template that turns a single
search term into a complete, evidence-bound portrait of its literature. Applied to
**Modafinil**, it retrieved and de-duplicated 2334 records across
10 engines (arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, Crossref, PubMed, SovietRxiv, ChinaRxiv, Europe PMC, bioRxiv/medRxiv, and medrxiv), classified them into 6 configurable
subfields (with **Clinical Sleep** dominant at 63.0\%), extracted
5 topics over a 500-feature vocabulary, computed
reproducible document embeddings, mapped the citation network (2234 nodes,
8,623 edges, 1416 communities), and framed
6 hypotheses for optional evidence scoring.

## Key Findings

The analysis answers the four research questions posed in the introduction:

1. **RQ1 (Growth)**: The modafinil literature spans 26 years
   (2000--2026) and grows at a CAGR of 5.48\%, doubling every
   9.2 years. The peak year 2025 produced 147
   publications, indicating sustained and active research interest.

2. **RQ2 (Subfields)**: The 6-bucket taxonomy reveals a multi-disciplinary
   literature dominated by clinical sleep research (63.0\%), with
   significant representation from cognition, psychiatry, and pharmacology.

3. **RQ3 (Topics)**: NMF extracted 5 latent topics — cognitive enhancement,
   ADHD treatment, pharmacological dose-response, sleep disorders, and psychiatric
   fatigue — that cross-cut the explicit subfield taxonomy and reveal the thematic
   structure of the field.

4. **RQ4 (Citations)**: The citation network of 2234 nodes and
   8,623 edges has a resolution rate of 22.4\%,
   1416 communities, and a maximum in-degree of
   163. The heavy-tailed degree distribution is characteristic of
   citation networks, with a small number of foundational works anchoring the structure.

## Architectural Contribution

The contribution is architectural rather than topical: every domain-specific value flows
from one configuration file and the pipeline's own outputs into a generated manuscript,
so the same machinery re-targets to any topic by editing configuration alone. Combined
with an offline, deterministic default run, this yields a *living literature review* — a
synthesis that can be re-executed on demand as a field evolves, with every number
traceable to a regenerable artifact.

## Reproducibility

This manuscript was generated from a live retrieval run using 10 engines.
Every number, table, and figure in this document is injected from a committed artifact
(`output/data/*.json`, `output/figures/*.png`). Re-running the pipeline with the same
configuration reproduces identical data outputs; the 21 figures are
deterministic given fixed seeds, and the manuscript text is regenerated from the same
template. No number in this document was typed by hand.
