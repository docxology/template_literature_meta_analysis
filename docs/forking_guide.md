# Forking & Re-targeting Guide — `template_literature_meta_analysis`

## The one idea to internalize

**Every domain-specific fact in the paper is injected from
[`manuscript/config.yaml`](../manuscript/config.yaml) and the pipeline's own
outputs.** The manuscript prose contains **no hard-coded topic terms** — it is
written entirely in `{{TOKENS}}` (`{{SEARCH_TERM_TITLE}}`, `{{CORPUS_SIZE}}`,
`{{SUBFIELD_TABLE}}`, `{{HYPOTHESIS_TABLE}}`, …). Re-targeting the config
re-targets the entire paper; you should not need to touch a single `manuscript/*.md`
body file to change topics. (Verified: the only place "modafinil" appears in
`manuscript/` is the authoring `README.md`.)

## TL;DR

```bash
# 0. From the repo root, install deps once
uv sync

# 1. Clean-copy the exemplar to your new project name (local-only fork)
uv run python scripts/copy_exemplar.py \
  --source templates/template_literature_meta_analysis \
  --dest projects/working/my_review \
  --new-name my_review

# 2. Edit ONE file: projects/working/my_review/manuscript/config.yaml
#    → project_config.search.{term,query,arxiv_queries,relevance_keywords}
#    → project_config.subfield_keywords  (your taxonomy)
#    → project_config.hypothesis_definitions  (your hypotheses)

# 3. Run the pipeline (from inside the project dir)
cd projects/working/my_review
uv run python scripts/01_literature_search.py --clear-corpus --no-resume
uv run python scripts/02_meta_analysis_pipeline.py
uv run python scripts/04_generate_figures.py
uv run python scripts/05_inject_variables.py     # fails loudly on any unresolved token

# 4. Render the PDF (from the repo root)
cd -
uv run python scripts/03_render_pdf.py --project working/my_review
```

**⚠️ Confidentiality invariant.** The repo `.gitignore` tracks **only** the public
canonical exemplars under `projects/templates/` (see
[`../../../docs/_generated/active_projects.md`](../../../../docs/_generated/active_projects.md)).
Your fork under `projects/working/my_review/` is local-only and won't be pushed
even with `git add -f` — `scripts/check_tracked_projects.py` blocks it in
`pre-push-quick`. See the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../../CLAUDE.md) "CONFIDENTIALITY INVARIANT".

## The single control surface: `manuscript/config.yaml`

Everything you need to re-target lives under `project_config:`. The blocks, in
the order you'll touch them:

### 1. `search` — what to fetch and how to filter

```yaml
project_config:
  search:
    term: "modafinil"                       # human-readable topic; drives titles, captions, word-cloud
    query: '"modafinil" OR "provigil" OR "armodafinil"'   # query for S2/OpenAlex/Crossref/PubMed
    start_year: 1990                        # drop anything older
    max_results: 1000                       # per-engine cap
    engines:                                # turn engines on/off independently
      arxiv: true
      openalex: true
      semantic_scholar: true
      crossref: true
      pubmed: true
    arxiv_queries:                          # arXiv uses its own field-prefixed syntax
      - 'all:"modafinil"'
      - 'all:"armodafinil"'
    relevance_keywords:                     # a paper is kept iff title+abstract contains ≥1 (case-insensitive)
      - "modafinil"
      - "wakefulness"
      - "narcolepsy"
```

**How the query is used per engine:** `query` is sent verbatim to Semantic
Scholar, OpenAlex, Crossref, and PubMed. arXiv is queried separately with each
entry in `arxiv_queries` (its API needs `all:"…"`/`ti:"…"` field prefixes).
If you leave `arxiv_queries`/`relevance_keywords` empty, the runner derives a
sensible fallback from `term`.

**Relevance filter (read this before you widen your keywords):** after retrieval,
a paper is dropped unless its title+abstract contains at least one
`relevance_keyword`. Keywords are matched **case-insensitively**, and an empty
list is treated as "no filter" (so you can't accidentally empty the corpus) —
but **over-narrow keywords silently shrink your corpus**. Start broad, inspect
`output/data/corpus.jsonl`, then tighten.

### 2. `subfield_keywords` — your taxonomy

Each top-level key is a subfield bucket; its list is the keyword set that
classifies a paper into that bucket. **Any number of buckets is supported** —
the `{{SUBFIELD_TABLE}}` and subfield figures adapt automatically.

```yaml
  subfield_keywords:
    clinical_sleep: ["narcolepsy", "shift work", "sleep apnea", "wakefulness"]
    cognition:      ["working memory", "attention", "executive function"]
    # … add/rename/remove buckets freely
```

### 3. `hypothesis_definitions` — what you want scored

Used by the optional knowledge-graph stage (03) to score the corpus's evidence
for/against each hypothesis. Keyed `H1`, `H2`, … with a `name`, `description`,
and `scope`. The `{{HYPOTHESIS_TABLE}}` renders these with an evidence score
that reads `pending` until stage 03 runs.

```yaml
  hypothesis_definitions:
    H1: { name: "Wakefulness Efficacy", description: "…", scope: "clinical" }
    H2: { name: "Cognitive Enhancement", description: "…", scope: "cognitive" }
```

### 4. Front-matter & optional blocks

- `paper.{title,subtitle}`, top-level `keywords:` — shown on the title page / abstract.
- `embeddings` — offline-deterministic `tfidf_svd` by default (`n_components`,
  `max_features`, `seed`); set `method: transformer` + install the `embeddings`
  extra to upgrade.
- `fulltext` — opt-in OA full-text download (needs an Unpaywall `email`).
- `knowledge_graph` / `llm_extraction` — stage-03 LLM settings (Ollama model,
  `min_confidence`, `max_papers`).

## The pipeline, end to end

| Stage | Script | Reads | Writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01_literature_search.py` | config | `output/data/corpus.jsonl` | 5-engine dispatch + cross-engine de-dup; `--clear-corpus --no-resume` for a fresh run |
| 2 | `02_meta_analysis_pipeline.py` | corpus | subfield/temporal/tfidf/topics/citation JSON + `citation_graph.gml` | deterministic (seeded) |
| 3 | `03_build_knowledge_graph.py` | corpus | nanopublications (JSONL + RDF/TriG), hypothesis scores | **optional** — needs Ollama; `--max-papers N` to sample |
| 4 | `04_generate_figures.py` | stage-2/3 JSON | up to 12 PNGs in `output/figures/` | KG-dependent figures skip gracefully if 03 didn't run |
| 5 | `05_inject_variables.py` | config + all outputs | `output/manuscript/*.md` | injects `{{TOKENS}}`; **raises on any unresolved token** |
| 6 | `06_fulltext_assessment.py` | corpus | full-text assessment | optional |

De-duplication is by `canonical_id` with priority **normalized-DOI > arXiv > S2 >
OpenAlex > title-digest**; DOIs are case/prefix-folded so the same paper from two
engines merges.

## What re-targeting does and doesn't require

| You change… | You must also… | Auto-handled? |
|---|---|---|
| `search.term` / `query` / `arxiv_queries` / `relevance_keywords` | nothing else | ✅ all prose/figures derive from outputs |
| `subfield_keywords` (add/rename/remove buckets) | nothing | ✅ `{{SUBFIELD_TABLE}}` + subfield figures adapt |
| `hypothesis_definitions` | nothing (run stage 03 for live scores) | ✅ `{{HYPOTHESIS_TABLE}}` adapts |
| `paper.title` / `keywords` | nothing | ✅ |
| Add a **new** computed number to the prose | add the token to `src/manuscript/variables.py::compute_variables` **and** reference `{{NEW_TOKEN}}` | ⚠️ unresolved tokens make stage 5 fail loudly |
| Add a **new search engine** | add a client in `src/literature/`, register it in `search_runner.py`, add an `engines:` toggle | ⚠️ code + test |

## Token discipline (why stage 5 fails loudly)

`05_inject_variables.py` replaces `{{TOKEN}}` in every `manuscript/*.md` (except
the authoring docs `README.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`SYNTAX.md`, and the lenient
`02e_methods_viz_injection.md` which documents the token system). If a body file
references a token that `compute_variables` doesn't produce, injection **raises a
`RuntimeError`** — there are no silent `{{…}}` leaks in the rendered PDF. So:

1. Add tokens to `compute_variables()` (see [`syntax_guide.md`](syntax_guide.md)).
2. Reference them as `{{TOKEN}}` in the manuscript.
3. Re-run stage 5; a clean exit means every token resolved.

## Verify your fork

```bash
# tests (90% project gate, zero mocks)
uv run pytest projects/working/my_review/tests/ --cov=projects/working/my_review/src --cov-fail-under=90 -q

# no unresolved tokens leaked into the rendered manuscript
grep -ro '{{[A-Z_0-9]*}}' projects/working/my_review/output/manuscript/ ; echo "exit=$? (1 = none found = good)"

# drift checker (global template integrity)
uv run python scripts/check_template_drift.py
```

## Common friction points (and fixes)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus is tiny / empty | `relevance_keywords` too narrow, or `query` too restrictive | Broaden keywords/query; inspect `output/data/corpus.jsonl`; remember the filter is case-insensitive substring |
| `Semantic Scholar: 0 papers` | S2 rate-limits (HTTP 429) without an API key | Expected; the run continues on the other engines. Set an S2 key for reliability |
| `RuntimeError: Unresolved variables in <file>` | A `{{TOKEN}}` isn't produced by `compute_variables` | Add it there, or remove the token from the manuscript |
| `{{TOKEN}}` literal in PDF | Stage 5 not re-run after a manuscript/config edit | Re-run `05_inject_variables.py` |
| Hypothesis scores all read `pending` | Stage 03 (KG) hasn't run, or no Ollama | Run `03_build_knowledge_graph.py` (needs Ollama); scores then populate |
| `mmdc could not find Chrome` at PDF stage | Mermaid blocks need `chrome-headless-shell` | `npx --yes puppeteer browsers install chrome-headless-shell` |
| Stale `*.egg-info/` after rename | editable install under old name | `rm -rf src/*.egg-info/` (already git-ignored) |

## Sibling exemplars

If your work isn't a literature review, fork a closer sibling instead:
[`template_code_project`](../../template_code_project) (code-centric, algorithm + analysis),
[`template_prose_project`](../../template_prose_project) (prose review, no algorithm),
or [`template_textbook`](../../template_textbook) (book-length manuscript).
